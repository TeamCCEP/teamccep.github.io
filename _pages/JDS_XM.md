## Introduction

# Introduction to Experience Management Post Interaction and Post Call Surveys

> Experience Management is a next-gen tool that facilitates post interaction surveys and outcomes. It allows you to track and measure customer satisfaction using anchor metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Effort Score (CES), and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT). Webex Contact Center brings in an integration of Experience Management for its post call survey interactive voice response (PCS IVR) and digital channels.

## JDS Feature Overview

CJDS is an API-first service that enables organizations to:

- `Listen`: Integrate with any data source or third-party applications to listen to disparate data sources (_e.g. customer
  called Support_).
- `Identify`: Create a dynamic customer profile capturing propensity drivers, such as a customer's preferred mode of communication or preferred language (_e.g. how many times has the customer contacted us in the last week in each channel?_).
- `Analyze`: Apply different aggregation techniques to all customer data collected (_e.g. What is the CSAT score of the customer interaction? Is he using telephony,chat or other channel to contact?_).
- `Act`: Use the data and insights within CJDS to dynamically change the flow within Webex Contact Center Flow Control and personalize the customer experience at a granular level. These insights are visible to customer-facing teams in real time through Agent Desktop. (_e.g. bypass normal queue when customer calls for the third time in 24 hours and offer premium support_).

A comprehensive summary of the feature is available in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.webex-cx.com/documentation/guides/journey---getting-started), where you can find all the vital information & step-by-step guide to enable JDS for the first time in your own tenant.



## Provision JDS 

1. `Fill out` this [form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/7776df72239e47d0bbb73a392e32927f) to have CJDS provisioned for your tenant enabled, as it **not**  enabled by default . If applicable, please work together with your CSM to ensure a smooth process and enablement.Post the initial request, the Cisco team will provision the CJDS instance  within 72 hours

2. When JDS is provisioned for the tenant, `Customer Journey Data` tab appears in the Control Hub

3. You can set how long to retain data that's captured for CJDS. We recommend that you keep a minimum of 180 days to make sure that there are sufficient end-user journey data. By default, data is retained for 365 days

   a. Sign in to Control Hub and go to `Customer Journey Data` > `Settings`

   b. Enter the **number of days** that you want to retain data in CJDS

4. Click `Save`

## Setup Desktop Customer Journey Widget

The customer Journey widget provides a single pane of glass view to the customer’s journey across all channels and applications, giving you the necessary contextual data for a more personalized customer experience and reducing average handling time.

### Create a journey project and Activate Webex Contact Center connector

`Journey projects` help organizations manage multiple data sources. Each journey project has a unique identifier which is required to leverage CJDS APIs payloads. Note that `project IDs` in Control Hub are referred to as `workspace IDs` in APIs.
Jouney project may be activated with the  `Webex Contact Center connector` This allows the journey project to capture all customer events and send it to CJDS from Contact Center. Once the connector is activated in one project, it cannot be activated in another. At any point in time, it can be enabled for only one project

1. Sign in to **Control Hub** and go to `Customer Journey Data > Journey projects`.

2. You can use the default Sandbox Project or click `Create a Journey Project`.

3. Enter a **name** and a **description** for the journey project.

4. Select the `journey project` that you created in previous step.

5. Toggle the `Activate` connector in the Webex Contact Center section to on.

![jdsactivateconnector](/assets/images/JDS/jds_activate_connector.gif)

### Add user identities to a journey project.

1. Select the `journey project` for which connector was activated.

2. Select `Identities`. Click on `Add identities`.

3. Download the sample template.

4. In CSV file download, add the Customer identities [First Name,Last Name,Email Addresses,Phone Numbers,Customers Ids].
   Each customer identity must have **at least** an email address, phone number, or customer ID or else the CSV file will return an error.
   If you want to add **multiple** email addresses, phone numbers or customer IDs, you need to **use the pipe “|” delimiter** between them. For example, try to add your phone number both with and without a plus sign

   For the **Id column**, make sure to leave each row empty. When you upload the CSV file, this field will auto-generate.

   ![jdscreatedcsv](/assets/images/JDS/jds_created_csv.png)
   
5. Upload the **CSV file** that you created for customer identities, and then click `Next`.

6. If the CSV file is valid, a window appears to show you if the import was successful. Once you're done, select `Close`. You should see a list of all the uploaded customer identities.

![jdsuploadidentities](/assets/images/JDS/jds_upload_ids.gif)

### Enable customer journey widget on an agent desktop

1. Download the following Desktop Layout JSON file [JDSDesktopLayout](/assets/files//JDSDesktopLayout10.json).

2. Sign in to Control Hub and go to `Contact Center > Desktop Layouts`.

3. Create a `new Layout`.

4. Assign an `Agent Team`.

5. Upload the Desktop Layout JSON file that you downloaded in step 1.

6. Click `Save`.

 Here is a screenshot of the block in place (notice it is after `IVR_TRASNCRIPT` and before `WXM_JOURNEY_TAB`).

   ![JDSWidgetCode](/assets/images/JDS/JDS_Widget_Code.png)

### View customer journey widget on an Agent desktop

1. Login as an Agent into Agent Desktop. Ensure that `desktop layout` of Agent's Team has `JDS Widget` configured in previous steps

2. On Accepting an incoming request `CJDS Widget` will appear in the desktop.

The widget displays insights such as the number of times the customer has called or was contacted across all channels during a given duration. It also displays the journey history with `wrap-up code`, `queue name`, `agent ID`, and so on, and customizable event history such as third-party events and custom icons.

The `progressive profile` allows for alignment of different phone numbers and emails under one profile, ensuring accurate and comprehensive interaction data.

![JDSWidgetDesktop](/assets/images/JDS/jds_desktop_widget.gif)

## JDS APIs

### API Documentation & Definitions

AS JDS is an API-first solution, there is a wide range of APIs available. All the APIs can be found in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.webex-cx.com/documentation/journey), where -as with all APIs- there is information on how to create the API request, the path/query parameters, the expected response as well as a sample code example. For more information on Webex Contact Center APIs & Authentication, you can follow and the complete the [API Lab - Lab 11](https://webexcc.github.io/pages/API/).

![JourneyDevPortal](/assets/images/JDS/JDS_Dev_Portal.png)

To be able to understand all the capabilities these APIs offer, it is important to become familiar with a few terms used in them:

- `Project / Workspace`: A uniquely identified entity that includes a specific set of JDS configurations and data sources.
  - At any given moment, only one project can be active per tenant (i.e. listen to events).
- `Subscription`: The events that JDS listens on, e.g. all the agent activity state changes/logins/logouts are one default JDS subscription.
- `Identity / Person`: A unique customer, all the events that the same customer (e.g. call, chat, email, visit website) creates are marked under the same identity.
- `Alias`: Different ways we can identify the same customer/person (e.g. email, phone number, Customer ID). Customer **must have at least one alias**.
- `Profile Template`: A profile template defines the kind of aggregation technique we want to see for a customer (e.g. contacts within last 24 hours).
- `Progressive Profile`: The values that correspond to an identity’s profile template at that particular moment of time (e.g. contacts within last 24 hours = 10).
- `Actions`: Actions can mean two different things in the concept of JDS:
  - The logical concept of differentiating the experience based on the result of Analyze (e.g. Call priority for repeated callers).
  - An automated programmatic response to events (e.g. send an SMS to a repeated caller).

### JDS API Collection

As there a lot of different APIs available in JDS, to make the introduction to them easier, Cisco has created a [JDS API Collection](https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-contact-center-api-samples/blob/main/customer-journey-samples/cjds-postman-example/JDS%20CiscoLive.postman_collection.json) as a starting point. In this segment, we will download this collection and import it to `Postman`, but any other API design platform can be used.

1. Download the JDS Postman collection, by going to the [GitHub samples page](https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-contact-center-api-samples/blob/main/customer-journey-samples/cjds-postman-example/JDS%20CiscoLive.postman_collection.json).

2. Click on **Download raw file**.
   ![JDSDownloadRaw](/assets/images/JDS/JDSDownloadRaw.png)

3. Open the `Postman` app and click on the **Import** button.

4. Select the **downloaded JSON file** in the appeared window.
   ![JDSImport](/assets/images/JDS/JDSImport.png)

5. Once the JDS collection is imported, select the root folder of the imported collection in the left menu, then navigate to the **Variables**, and define the values.

6. Once the values are defined, click the **Save** button.
   ![JDSSave](/assets/images/JDS/JDSSave.png)

7. Go to **Authorization** and click on **Get New Access Token** button. The Postman will redirect you to the Auth page where you need to define your Admin account which was used for the App creation in the dev portal. As a result, you should get the message **Authentication complete**. Click **Proceed** and on the next page click on **Use Token** button.
   ![JDSAuth](/assets/images/JDS/authJDS.gif)

After successfully saving your JDS API collection in Postman, you can also check on the following video that shows how to use combinations of these APIs to manage your JDS profiles and templates.
