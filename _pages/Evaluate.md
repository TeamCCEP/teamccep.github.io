**Evaluate** is a node within a Webex Connect flow, which allows you to execute Javascript code.

While similar to Functions in WxCC Flow Designer, the Evaluate node runs on the [Rhino JS Engine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_(JavaScript_engine)>), and therefore, [is not compatible](https://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html) with more common Javascript programming features and concepts.

With this in mind, you likely cannot use typical AI code generation tools, even the built-in one inside of Webex Connect. You might have success with the results, but you also might be fighting an unwinnable battle.
